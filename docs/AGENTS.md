# SyncKaro Platform - AI Agent Context Guide

> **Last Updated:** October 30, 2025  
> **Version:** 1.0.0  
> **Purpose:** This document provides comprehensive context for AI agents working on the SyncKaro platform. Read this thoroughly before making any changes.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

**SyncKaro** is a **Copy Trading / Social Trading Platform** that enables teachers (experienced traders) to share their trades with students (follower traders) in real-time. The platform consists of three separate applications serving different user roles.

### Platform Purpose
- Teachers execute trades that are automatically copied to their students' accounts
- Admins monitor all activity, trades, and statistics across the platform
- Students follow teachers, manage their profiles, and view their trading performance

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Three-App Ecosystem

```
SyncKaro/
├── synckaro_admin_nextjs/        # Admin Dashboard (Web)
├── synckaro_teacher_nextjs/      # Teacher Dashboard (Web)
└── synckaro_student_reactnative/ # Student App (Mobile)
```

### Tech Stack

| Module | Framework | Styling | State Management |
|--------|-----------|---------|------------------|
| **Admin** | Next.js 14+ (App Router) | Pure TailwindCSS (Refined Premium) | Local Storage (for now) |
| **Teacher** | Next.js 14+ (App Router) | Pure TailwindCSS (Refined Premium) | Local Storage (for now) |
| **Student** | React Native Expo | Nativewind | Local Storage (for now) |

**Note:** Using pure TailwindCSS with custom components for full control and professional "Refined Premium" design system.

### Key Technologies
- **TypeScript**: Strictly typed across all apps
- **Axios**: HTTP client with interceptors for API calls
- **localStorage**: Client-side storage for local-first approach
- **Pure TailwindCSS**: Custom components with professional color system
- **Heroicons**: Icon library from Tailwind creators (includes Rupee icons for India)
- **Refined Premium Design**: Professional UI suitable for financial/trading platforms

### State Management (Future Implementation)
- **TanStack Query** or **Zustand** will be evaluated and implemented during actual API integration
- Pros/cons will be assessed when backend integration begins
- For now, use localStorage for all data persistence

### Backend Architecture
- **Backend already exists** - Focus on frontend development only
- **Local-first approach**: Start with localStorage, migrate to API later
- Axios client with interceptors ready for future API integration
- Authentication currently handled via localStorage

- Update `app.json`: slug → "synckaro-student", identifier
- Nativewind already configured
- Basic layout: Header, Footer, Sidebar
- Touch-friendly UI (minimum 44px touch targets)
- Native navigation patterns
- Platform-specific components (iOS/Android)

## 🎨 UI/UX Guidelines

### Design Principles
1. **Consistency**: Admin and Teacher apps must have identical UI patterns
2. **Gmail-style Lists**: Bulk selection, action menus, clean layout
3. **Responsive**: Desktop (1024px+) and Tablet (768px+) ONLY for Admin/Teacher - Show blocking UI on mobile (<768px)
4. **Native Mobile**: Student app is React Native Expo (native mobile app, not responsive web)
5. **Accessibility**: Custom accessible components with ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
6. **Modern & Clean**: Professional trading dashboard aesthetic with "Refined Premium" design
7. **Component-Based Architecture**: Build reusable components - one change updates all consumers
8. **Real-World Colors**: Softer, professional palette inspired by Zerodha, Upstox, Bloomberg Terminal

### Component Library Strategy

**Pure TailwindCSS Custom Components:**
- **Modal/ConfirmDialog**: Confirmations, forms, details with React Portal
- **Dropdown**: Action menus, filters with click-outside-to-close
- **Toggle**: Active/inactive status switches
- **Button**: All variants (primary, secondary, danger, success, ghost)
- **Input**: Form inputs with validation states
- **StatusBadge**: Color-coded status indicators
- **Table**: Data tables with sorting, pagination
- **SearchBar**: Search inputs with icons
- **BulkActionBar**: Bottom sheet for bulk operations
- **EmptyState**: No-data placeholders
- **Pagination**: Page navigation controls

**Component Features:**
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, focus management
- **Animations**: Smooth transitions with TailwindCSS utilities
- **Click Outside**: Dropdown and modal close on outside click
- **Escape Key**: Close modals and dropdowns with Escape
- **Focus Trap**: Keep focus within modals
- **Professional Colors**: Refined Premium color palette throughout

### Figma Design Reference
- **Client has provided UI designs in Figma**
- Screenshots placed in admin folder: `synckaro_admin_reactjs/design-reference/`
- **Important**: Use Figma for layout positions and feature identification ONLY
- **DO NOT** copy Figma UI pixel-perfectly
- **DO** implement using Pure TailwindCSS with Refined Premium design system
- Follow modern UI/UX industry standards and best practices
- Build professional, trading-platform-quality UI
- Maintain functional layout structure while improving aesthetics

### Professional Color System (Refined Premium)

**Implemented in** `app/globals.css` using TailwindCSS v4's `@theme` directive:

```css
/* Primary - Professional Blue (not too bright) */
--color-primary-600: #2563eb;  /* Main brand color */
--color-primary-700: #1d4ed8;  /* Hover states */

/* Success - Softer Green (profits, active states) */
--color-success-600: #16a34a;  /* Main success */
--color-success-700: #15803d;  /* Darker variant */

/* Danger - Softer Red (losses, warnings) */
--color-danger-500: #ef4444;   /* Main danger */
--color-danger-600: #dc2626;   /* Darker variant */

/* Warning - Softer Yellow/Orange (pending states) */
--color-warning-600: #d97706;  /* Main warning */

/* Neutral - Professional Grays (text, backgrounds) */
--color-neutral-50: #fafafa;   /* Page background */
--color-neutral-100: #f5f5f5;  /* Card backgrounds */
--color-neutral-200: #e5e5e5;  /* Borders */
--color-neutral-500: #737373;  /* Secondary text */
--color-neutral-700: #404040;  /* Primary text (not pure black!) */
```

**Color Usage Guidelines:**
- Use `primary-600` for brand elements (not 500 - too bright)
- Use `success-600` for profits/active states
- Use `danger-500` for losses/warnings
- Use `neutral-700` for main text (not pure black - easier on eyes)
- Use `neutral-500` for secondary text
- Avoid harsh, bright colors - keep it professional

**See** `docs/COLOR_SYSTEM.md` for complete color documentation.

### Component Patterns (Pure TailwindCSS)

**Dropdown (replaces Menu):**
```tsx
import { Dropdown } from '@/components/common/Dropdown';

<Dropdown
  items={[
    { label: 'View Details', icon: <EyeIcon />, onClick: handleView },
    { label: 'Delete', icon: <TrashIcon />, onClick: handleDelete, danger: true },
  ]}
/>
```

**Modal/ConfirmDialog:**
```tsx
import { ConfirmDialog } from '@/components/common/Modal';

<ConfirmDialog
  open={isOpen}
  onClose={() => setIsOpen(false)}
  onConfirm={handleConfirm}
  title="Delete Teacher"
  message="Are you sure? This action cannot be undone."
  danger
/>
```

**Status Toggle:**
```tsx
import { Toggle } from '@/components/common/Toggle';

<Toggle
  enabled={isActive}
  onChange={setIsActive}
  label="Active Status"
/>
```

**Bulk Selection Checkbox:**
```tsx
<input
  type="checkbox"
  checked={isSelected}
  onChange={handleSelect}
  className="h-4 w-4 rounded border-neutral-300 text-primary-600 focus:ring-primary-500"
/>
```

**Status Badge:**
```tsx
import { StatusBadge } from '@/components/common/StatusBadge';

<StatusBadge status="active" />  {/* Green */}
<StatusBadge status="inactive" /> {/* Gray */}
```

## 🔧 State Management (Current Approach)

### Local Storage (Phase 1 - Current Implementation)

**Purpose:** Client-side data persistence for local-first approach

**Storage Keys Convention:**
- `syncKaro_auth` – Authentication payload (user, token, role)
- `syncKaro_teachers` – Seeded teacher directory with computed stats
- `syncKaro_students` – Student roster linked to teachers
- `syncKaro_trades` – Trade history (teacher + mirrored student fills)
- `syncKaro_activityLogs` – Timeline entries for teacher activity feeds
- `syncKaro_stats` – Aggregate snapshot (totals, capital, P&L, win rate)
- `syncKaro_seedDataGeneratedAt` – ISO timestamp of the last seed refresh
- `syncKaro_connections` – Connection requests (placeholder for teacher/student linking)

**Example Implementation:**
```typescript
// lib/storage.ts
export const storage = {
  // Auth
  setAuth: (data: AuthData) => localStorage.setItem('syncKaro_auth', JSON.stringify(data)),
  getAuth: (): AuthData | null => {
    const data = localStorage.getItem('syncKaro_auth');
    return data ? JSON.parse(data) : null;
  },
  clearAuth: () => localStorage.removeItem('syncKaro_auth'),
  
  // Generic CRUD
  setItem: (key: string, value: any) => localStorage.setItem(`syncKaro_${key}`, JSON.stringify(value)),
  getItem: (key: string) => {
    const data = localStorage.getItem(`syncKaro_${key}`);
    return data ? JSON.parse(data) : null;
  },
  removeItem: (key: string) => localStorage.removeItem(`syncKaro_${key}`),
};
```

### Future State Management (Phase 2 - API Integration)

**To Be Decided:** TanStack Query vs Zustand vs Redux
- Pros/cons will be evaluated during API implementation
- Decision based on:
  - Caching requirements
  - Real-time update needs
  - Team familiarity
  - Performance considerations

**For Now:**
- ❌ **DO NOT** implement TanStack Query
- ❌ **DO NOT** implement Zustand
- ✅ **USE** localStorage for all data operations
- ✅ **PREPARE** axios client with interceptors (for future API integration)

## 🔌 API Integration (Future - Phase 2)

### Axios Client Setup (Prepare but don't use yet)

```typescript
// lib/api.ts
import axios from 'axios';
import { storage } from './storage';

const api = axios.create({
  baseURL: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL || 'http://localhost:3001/api',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
});

// Request interceptor (add auth token)
api.interceptors.request.use((config) => {
  const auth = storage.getAuth();
  if (auth?.token) {
    config.headers.Authorization = `Bearer ${auth.token}`;
  }
  return config;
});

// Response interceptor (handle errors)
api.interceptors.response.use(
  (response) => response.data,
  (error) => {
    if (error.response?.status === 401) {
      storage.clearAuth();
      window.location.href = '/login';
    }
    return Promise.reject(error);
  }
);

export default api;
```

**Note:** This is prepared but not used yet. All operations currently use localStorage.

## 🔐 Authentication

### Auth Flow

1. **Teacher Signup:**
   - Enter mobile number
   - Receive OTP (6-digit code)
   - Verify OTP to complete signup
   - After successful signup → automatically appear in Admin dashboard
   - No admin approval required

2. **Student Signup:**
   - Enter mobile number
   - Receive OTP
   - Verify OTP to complete signup
   - Start as "zombie students" (no teacher association)
   - Can immediately search for teachers

3. **Admin Login:**
   - **Dummy Admin Credentials:**
     - Mobile: `9999999999`
     - OTP: `1234`
   - Single admin account (no CRUD for now)
   - May add admin CRUD later based on client requirements

### Auth Types

```typescript
// types/auth.ts
interface AuthData {
  user: {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    mobile: string;
    role: 'admin' | 'teacher' | 'student';
    email?: string;
  };
  token: string;
  isAuthenticated: boolean;
}

interface SignupData {
  name: string;
  mobile: string;
  email?: string;
  role: 'teacher' | 'student';
}

interface OTPVerifyData {
  mobile: string;
  otp: string;
}
```

### Auth with localStorage

```typescript
// services/authService.ts
import { storage } from '@/lib/storage';

export const authService = {
  // Signup
  signup: (data: SignupData) => {
    // Store in localStorage
    // In production, this will be API call
  },
  
  // Verify OTP
  verifyOTP: (data: OTPVerifyData) => {
    // For admin: check if mobile is 9999999999 and OTP is 1234
    // For others: verify OTP (dummy implementation for now)
    if (data.mobile === '9999999999' && data.otp === '1234') {
      const authData: AuthData = {
        user: {
          id: 'admin-1',
          name: 'Admin',
          mobile: '9999999999',
          role: 'admin',
        },
        token: 'dummy-admin-token',
        isAuthenticated: true,
      };
      storage.setAuth(authData);
      return authData;
    }
    // Handle other users...
  },
  
  // Logout
  logout: () => {
    storage.clearAuth();
  },
  
  // Check if authenticated
  isAuthenticated: () => {
    const auth = storage.getAuth();
    return auth?.isAuthenticated || false;
  },
};
```

### Protected Routes (Industry Standard)

```typescript
// components/auth/ProtectedRoute.tsx
'use client';

import { useEffect } from 'react';
import { useRouter, usePathname } from 'next/navigation';
import { storage } from '@/lib/storage';

export function ProtectedRoute({ 
  children, 
  allowedRoles 
}: { 
  children: React.ReactNode;
  allowedRoles?: ('admin' | 'teacher' | 'student')[];
}) {
  const router = useRouter();
  const pathname = usePathname();

  useEffect(() => {
    const auth = storage.getAuth();
    
    // Not authenticated
    if (!auth?.isAuthenticated) {
      router.push(`/login?redirect=${encodeURIComponent(pathname)}`);
      return;
    }
    
    // Check role-based access
    if (allowedRoles && !allowedRoles.includes(auth.user.role)) {
      router.push('/unauthorized');
      return;
    }
  }, [pathname, router, allowedRoles]);

  const auth = storage.getAuth();
  
  if (!auth?.isAuthenticated) return null;
  if (allowedRoles && !allowedRoles.includes(auth.user.role)) return null;
  
  return <>{children}</>;
}
```

### Usage in Layout

```typescript
// app/layout.tsx or specific page
import { ProtectedRoute } from '@/components/auth/ProtectedRoute';

export default function AdminLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <ProtectedRoute allowedRoles={['admin']}>
      {children}
    </ProtectedRoute>
  );
}
```

---

## 🚀 Performance Optimization

### TanStack Query Configuration
```typescript
// lib/queryClient.ts
import { QueryClient } from '@tanstack/react-query';

export const queryClient = new QueryClient({
  defaultOptions: {
    queries: {
      staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000,       // 5 minutes
      cacheTime: 10 * 60 * 1000,      // 10 minutes
      retry: 1,
      refetchOnWindowFocus: false,
    },
  },
});
```

### Code Splitting
- Use dynamic imports for heavy components
- Lazy load pages not immediately needed
```typescript
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic';

const TeacherStats = dynamic(() => import('@/components/teachers/TeacherStats'), {
  loading: () => <Spinner />,
});
```

### Image Optimization
- Use Next.js `<Image>` component
- Optimize images before upload
- Use appropriate formats (WebP when possible)

---

## 📝 Code Conventions

### Naming Conventions
- **Components**: PascalCase (e.g., `TeacherTable.tsx`)
- **Utilities**: camelCase (e.g., `formatCurrency.ts`)
- **Hooks**: camelCase with "use" prefix (e.g., `useTeachers.ts`)
- **Stores**: camelCase with "use" prefix (e.g., `useAuthStore.ts`)
- **Types/Interfaces**: PascalCase (e.g., `Teacher`, `StudentFormData`)
- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `API_BASE_URL`)

### File Organization
- One component per file
- Co-locate related files (e.g., `TeacherTable.tsx` and `TeacherTable.test.tsx`)
- Group by feature, not by type
- **No file size restrictions** - keep code logical and readable

### TypeScript
- Strictly typed - no `any` types
- Define interfaces for all data structures
- Use type inference where appropriate
- Export types from `types/index.ts`

### CSS/Styling
- Use TailwindCSS utility classes
- Keep custom CSS minimal
- Use `clsx` or `cn` utility for conditional classes
```typescript
import { clsx } from 'clsx';

<button className={clsx(
  'px-4 py-2 rounded',
  isActive ? 'bg-blue-500 text-white' : 'bg-gray-200 text-gray-700'
)}>
```

### Comments
- Use JSDoc for functions
- Comment complex logic
- Avoid obvious comments
```typescript
/**
 * Fetches teacher data with pagination and optional search
 * @param page - Page number (1-indexed)
 * @param search - Optional search query
 * @returns Paginated teacher data
 */
export async function getTeachers(page: number, search?: string) {
  // Implementation
}
```

## 🧩 Component-Based Architecture

### Core Principle
**Build reusable components once, use everywhere. One change updates all instances automatically.**

### Component Guidelines

#### 1. **Build Reusable Components**
Create common components that can be used across the application:
- `Button` - All button variations (primary, secondary, danger, etc.)
- `Input` - All input types (text, email, number, etc.)
- `Card` - Content containers
- `Table` - Data tables with sorting, pagination
- `Modal` - Dialogs and confirmations
- `Badge` - Status indicators
- `Dropdown` - Select menus
- `Checkbox` - Checkboxes with proper states
- `Toggle` - Switch components

#### 2. **Single Source of Truth**
- One component file, used everywhere
- Example: Create `Button.tsx` once → use in forms, headers, tables, modals
- Update `Button` styling → all buttons across the app update automatically
- Add loading state to `Button` → all instances inherit the feature

#### 3. **Props-Driven Flexibility**
Make components flexible with props:
```typescript
// components/common/Button.tsx
interface ButtonProps {
  variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'danger' | 'ghost';
  size?: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg';
  loading?: boolean;
  disabled?: boolean;
  fullWidth?: boolean;
  icon?: React.ReactNode;
  onClick?: () => void;
  children: React.ReactNode;
}

export function Button({ 
  variant = 'primary', 
  size = 'md', 
  loading = false,
  ...props 
}: ButtonProps) {
  // Implementation
}
```

**Usage:**
```typescript
<Button variant="primary" size="lg" loading={isSubmitting}>
  Save Changes
</Button>

<Button variant="danger" size="sm" icon={<TrashIcon />}>
  Delete
</Button>
```

#### 4. **Composition Pattern**
Build complex UIs by composing simple components:
```typescript
// Complex form built from simple components
<Card>
  <Card.Header>
    <Heading>Create Teacher</Heading>
  </Card.Header>
  <Card.Body>
    <Form>
      <Input label="Name" />
      <Input label="Email" type="email" />
      <Button variant="primary">Submit</Button>
    </Form>
  </Card.Body>
</Card>
```

#### 5. **Consistent Behavior**
- All buttons have same hover/active/disabled states
- All inputs have same validation styling
- All modals have same transition/backdrop
- All tables have same sorting/pagination UI

#### 6. **Component Structure**
```
components/
├── common/              # Shared across entire app
│   ├── Button.tsx
│   ├── Input.tsx
│   ├── Card.tsx
│   ├── Modal.tsx
│   ├── Table.tsx
│   ├── Badge.tsx
│   ├── Dropdown.tsx
│   └── Toggle.tsx
├── layout/              # Layout-specific
│   ├── Sidebar.tsx
│   ├── Header.tsx
│   └── Footer.tsx
└── teachers/            # Feature-specific (composed from common)
    ├── TeacherTable.tsx    # Uses common/Table
    ├── TeacherCard.tsx     # Uses common/Card
    └── TeacherForm.tsx     # Uses common/Input, Button
```

#### 7. **Benefits**
- **Consistency**: Same look and feel everywhere
- **Maintainability**: Change once, update everywhere
- **Development Speed**: Reuse instead of rebuild
- **Bug Fixes**: Fix in one place, fixed everywhere
- **Easy Refactoring**: Update component API, all uses update
- **Testing**: Test component once, confident everywhere

#### 8. **Example: Button Component Evolution**
```typescript
// Step 1: Create basic button
<Button>Click Me</Button>

// Step 2: Add loading state to Button component
// All existing buttons now support loading!
<Button loading={isLoading}>Click Me</Button>

// Step 3: Add icon support to Button component
// All existing buttons can now have icons!
<Button icon={<PlusIcon />}>Add Teacher</Button>

// No need to update existing code - just new features available!
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**TanStack Query not refetching:**
- Check `staleTime` configuration
- Use `queryClient.invalidateQueries()` after mutations
- Verify query keys are consistent

**Custom components not working:**
- Verify click-outside listeners are properly attached
- Check React Portal is rendering for modals
- Ensure focus trap is working in modals
- Test keyboard navigation (Escape, Tab)

**Bulk selection not working:**
- Verify checkbox state management in parent component
- Ensure unique IDs for each item
- Check selectedIds array is updating correctly

**API calls failing:**
- Check API base URL in `.env.local`
- Verify auth token is included in headers
- Check network tab for error responses
- Ensure backend is running

**Mobile blocking not working:**
- Check media queries in CSS
- Verify screen width detection
- Test in browser responsive mode

## ⚠️ Important Notes for AI Agents

1. **Always read this file first** before making any changes
2. **Pure TailwindCSS ONLY** - NO Headless UI, custom components with Refined Premium design
3. **Admin app is top priority** - start here
4. **Local-first approach** - use localStorage, NO TanStack Query or Zustand yet
5. **Figma for layout reference ONLY** - DO NOT copy UI exactly, use Refined Premium design
6. **Professional color palette** - See COLOR_SYSTEM.md, softer colors for trading platform
7. **Authentication is mobile + OTP** - admin dummy: 9999999999 / 1234
8. **Protected routes** - implement with industry best practices
9. **Teachers self-onboard** - admin cannot create teachers
10. **Admin & Teacher apps are desktop/tablet only (≥768px)** - show blocking UI on mobile
11. **Zombie students** are unassociated - important concept
12. **Gmail-style UI** - bulk selection, clean lists, action menus
13. **Stats page** - create UI with assumed fields (not discussed with client)
14. **Logs page** - show dummy trade history data
15. **Panic button** - critical safety feature for teachers
16. **Connection requests** - complex logic, follow rules carefully
17. **Axios client ready** - prepared with interceptors but use localStorage for now
18. **No file size limits** - keep code logical and readable
19. **Heroicons** - use for all icons (includes Rupee icons)
20. **No emojis in production code** - keep it professional
21. **Component-based architecture** - build reusable components, change once update everywhere
22. **TypeScript strictly** - no `any` types
23. **Real-world colors** - text-neutral-700 (not black), softer greens/reds, professional palette
24. **Refined Premium UI** - Clean, professional, functional - not over-fancy
25. **Test thoroughly** - especially bulk operations and trading features
